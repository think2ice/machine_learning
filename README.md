# machine_learning
This is a repository to store all the laboratory session of ML (Machine Learning), a subject of MIRI (Master in Research and Innovation in Informatics). Several sessions in different topics will be added, such as clustering, classification, regression, etc. 
The schema of a lab session is usually two files: part 1, where you follow the teacher's code and learn the basics of the topic and part 2, where you used what you have learned in part 1 to solve a new problem. All the sessions are developed with R language.
